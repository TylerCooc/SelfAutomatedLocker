For Team Degen's senior project we are designing and building a self - automated touchless locker (S.A.T.L).
This locker aims at minimizing the users physical contact, that they would normally encounter with a locker.
In order to achieve this we will be implementing two motors a Servo and Stepper motor.
Our Servo motor will be used for our opening mechanism.
The Steper motor will be used for the locking mechanism.

These motors will be controlled using python code, and having a Raspberry Pi 4 as our main system, with two raspberry pi pico's as our sub systems.
